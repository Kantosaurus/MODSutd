# MODutd
Ultimate Tech Stack
Frontend

    Framework: Next.js with React
        Why: Next.js offers server-side rendering (SSR) for fast, SEO-friendly pages, plus a unified codebase for both front-end and backend API routes.
    Language: TypeScript
        Why: Enhances code quality with type safety.
    UI Library: Material-UI (MUI) or Tailwind CSS
        Why: Provides a responsive, modern design system.
    Drag-and-Drop: react-beautiful-dnd
        Why: Simplifies creating intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces for your timetable planner.
    State Management: Redux or React Context API
        Why: To manage complex state interactions (e.g., user session, mod planning data).

Backend

    Runtime & Server: Node.js using Next.js API routes or Express.js
        Why: Seamless integration with the frontend if you use Next.js, or a dedicated REST API if you prefer a separate backend.
    Database: PostgreSQL (or MySQL) with Prisma ORM
        Why: Relational databases are ideal for handling structured data (e.g., user accounts, module details, academic unit calculations) and Prisma boosts productivity with type-safe queries.
    Authentication: NextAuth.js or Firebase Authentication
        Why: Secure and scalable user authentication for sign up/log in.
    PDF Generation: Puppeteer or PDFKit
        Why: Puppeteer can render a web page to a PDF, which works well if your mod plan is already formatted as an HTML page.
    Email Service: NodeMailer integrated with SendGrid, Mailgun, or a similar service
        Why: For reliably sending mod plan PDFs via email.
    Academic Unit Calculation Logic: Custom server-side logic
        Why: To ensure accurate calculations for minors/tracks and enforce business rules.

DevOps & Deployment

    Hosting: Vercel (for Next.js apps)
        Why: Optimized for Next.js, with automatic scaling and serverless functions.
    Database Hosting: Cloud providers like Heroku Postgres, AWS RDS, or Google Cloud SQL.
    CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar
        Why: For automated testing, linting, and deployment pipelines.
    Monitoring & Error Tracking: Sentry or LogRocket
        Why: To monitor performance and catch errors early.

Development Plan
1. Planning & Requirements Gathering

    Define User Stories & Wireframes: Map out each feature (login, module reviews, drag-and-drop timetable, academic unit calculations, etc.).
    Database Schema Design: Create models for users, modules, term schedules, reviews, and academic requirements.

2. Design & Prototyping

    UI/UX Design: Use design tools (Figma, Sketch) to prototype the responsive interface.
    Component Library: Establish a set of reusable UI components using Material-UI or Tailwind CSS.

3. Development

    Frontend Development:
        Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript.
        Implement the responsive layout and navigation.
        Integrate drag-and-drop features using react-beautiful-dnd for the mod timetable.
    Backend Development:
        Create API routes (or an Express backend) for authentication, fetching modules, saving mod plans, and processing academic unit calculations.
        Integrate NextAuth.js or Firebase for authentication.
        Build endpoints to generate PDFs (using Puppeteer) and send emails (using NodeMailer).
    Integration:
        Connect frontend forms (login, mod planning, review submission) with the backend.
        Ensure secure data transactions and session management.

4. Testing

    Unit Testing: Use Jest/React Testing Library to test individual components and functions.
    Integration Testing: Verify the complete flow (e.g., creating a mod plan, generating PDF, sending email).
    Responsive Testing: Ensure the UI works seamlessly across devices.

5. Deployment & Maintenance

    Deployment:
        Deploy the Next.js app on Vercel.
        Use a managed database solution (e.g., Heroku Postgres) for your data.
    CI/CD Pipeline: Set up automated builds and tests.
    Monitoring: Implement logging and error monitoring tools to catch issues early and maintain performance.

Final Thoughts

This stack is both modern and scalable, providing:

    A unified environment (Next.js) for a smooth developer experience.
    Robust security and performance with reliable authentication and a structured database.
    An interactive and responsive UI with drag-and-drop functionality.
    Streamlined PDF generation and email integration.

This approach not only meets your current requirements but also sets a strong foundation for future features and scalability as MODutd grows.
