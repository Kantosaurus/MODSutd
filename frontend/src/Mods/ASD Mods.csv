20.201,Architecture Science and Technology,"The development of a building design to its actual construction is not a predetermined process. Each architectural design is an autonomous and unique scenario demanding a high level of creative invention supported by current and responsible technological knowledge. This understanding of the technology of assemblies should be less a mere familiarity with devices and products but rather, a working understanding of the forces, both general and specific, that affect the performance of building systems and the architecture. With this understanding, architects and engineers can then design physical assemblies and systems that both respond to and collaborate with these forces. The eventual humanity and beauty of any architectural construct is an almost pure reflection of the depth of both the thought of and individual, and the highly complex interactions of a collective effort. This course intends for the full depth of design possibilities to unfold and be revealed, not constrained, as technological issues are introduced. The building technology sequence in the core curriculum terms begins with an introduction to the performance requirements, physics and physical phenomena and construction systems of contemporary buildings. The intention of this class will be to link the diversity of physical forces relevant to building performance to the materials, components, assemblies and large scale systems that control and direct these forces and guide performance. This introduction will be phased to deliver to the entering Architecture and Sustainable Design student key concepts and essential analytical skills necessary for the rigorous selection and design of structural systems, enclosure and façade systems, environmental and energy systems, and circulation and interior systems. The scope of the class includes these major systems to an intermediate level of understanding and an introductory level of analysis and system design. Subsequent classes in the building technologies will build on all four systems in both detail complexity and integrative depth.

 

This class is an introduction to the science and physics of building design and performance and an understanding of contemporary building construction methods, materials, and technical information necessary for a responsible making of a humane built environment. It is also intended as an introduction to the historical foundations and cultural contexts in which construction technologies have been developed over time. The focus of the class will be put on an understanding of tectonic principles: the materials and components that comprise buildings, their relationship to the manufacturing processes, and the forces and physical phenomenon of performance requirements. Beyond that there will also be a substantial discussion of the environmental consequences of the construction and operation of the built environment. While the scope of the course is broad, it is not, and could never be, a comprehensive treatment of all issues regarding the design and construction of buildings.

Investigating the interdependencies evolving between a building’s entity and its urban territory students will speculate how strategies for urban building types have contributed in the past and can contribute in the future to urban development.

 

Participants will understand the relevance of housing typology research and the potentials of designer’s repositories of known housing precedents as design expertise. Having gained a clear understanding of concepts like ‘type’ and ‘typology’ students will analyse both contemporary and historical housing precedents of building types like Block Enclosure, Urban Infill, Solitaire, Superblock, Apartment Tower, Residential Estate and Urban Row Houses.

“the making present in some sense of something which is nevertheless not present literally or in fact.”

“architects don’t build buildings, they make drawings”1,
Evans, R. (1996) “Translations from Drawing to Building and Other Essays”. London: Architectural Association Publications

 

If drawings are our language as designers, we surely must then enrich our vocabulary and foster new modes of meaningful of expression to allow for the emergence of true poetry;

to communicate
to provoke
to seduce
to speculate

 

« forms & types of representation » operates as a testing laboratory for exploring the processes and methods embedded within the creative act of projecting.

 

This course attempts to both, provide a historical/theoretical context to the importance of the act of re-presentation -external to architecture, within contemporary critical thought, and to introduce a set of techniques to reconnect to the creative act, both to exceed design and to reinvent it through the formation of new narratives.

 

The examination of contemporary methodologies of media research and practice will provide a context for the better understanding of the why/how/when in relationship to history, technology and the human condition.

 

Our objective is to generate critical engagement with media by research -and application. We approach this through a two-fold strategy; on the one hand, a series of lectures and seminars, where new approaches to media are presented and dissected with the students through in-class analysis and textual responses. On the other hand, during the second part of the course, the students will be introduced to a variety of representation techniques, triggering hands on, in-class work lasting one week. Such assignments aim at constructing Tête-à-tête strategies that apply theoretical and practical knowledge, weaving them and (re)conceptualising the relationship between media and design through personal projects.

 

The goal is to ultimately sharpen students’ intellectual agility and to foster the reinvention of methods and mechanisms through which new modes of practice -in design and architecture, could emerge.",20.102,,,,,,"3-0-6*
